                            Mosquitoes (or mosquitos) are members of a group of almost 3,600 species of small flies within the family Culicidae (from
                            the Latin culex meaning "gnat").The word "mosquito" (formed by mosca and diminutive -ito) is Spanish for "little fly".
                            Mosquitoes have a slender segmented body, one pair of wings, one pair of halteres, three pairs of long hair-like legs,
                            and elongated mouthparts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The mosquito life cycle consists of egg, larva, pupa, and adult stages. Eggs are laid on the water surface; they hatch
                            into motile larvae that feed on aquatic algae and organic material. These larvae are important food sources for many
                            freshwater animals, such as dragonfly nymphs, many fish, and some birds such as ducks. The adult females of most
                            species have tube-like mouthparts (called a proboscis) that can pierce the skin of a host and feed on blood, which
                            contains protein and iron needed to produce eggs. Thousands of mosquito species feed on the blood of various
                            hosts ⁠— vertebrates, including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and some fish; along with some invertebrates,
                            primarily other arthropods.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The mosquito's saliva is transferred to the host during the bite, and can cause an itchy rash. In addition, many species
                            can ingest pathogens while biting, and transmit them to future hosts. In this way, mosquitoes are important vectors of
                            parasitic diseases such as malaria and filariasis, and arboviral diseases such as yellow fever, Chikungunya, West Nile,
                            dengue fever, and Zika. By transmitting diseases, mosquitoes cause the deaths of more people than any other animal
                            taxon: over 700,000 each year. It has been claimed that almost half of the people who have ever lived have died of
                            mosquito-vectored disease, but this claim is disputed, with more conservative estimates placing the death toll
                            closer to 5% of all humans. Mosquitoes cannot live or function properly when the air temperature is below 10
                            degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit).They are mostly active at 15–25 degrees Celsius (60–80 degrees Fahrenheit).
