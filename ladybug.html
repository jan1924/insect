                            Coccinellidae (/ˌkɒksɪˈnɛlɪˌdiː/) is a widespread family of small beetles ranging in size from 0.8 to 18 mm (0.03–0.7 in).
                            They are commonly known as ladybugs in North America and ladybirds in Great Britain. Some entomologists prefer the 
                            names ladybird beetles or lady beetles as they are not true bugs. Many of the species have conspicuous aposematic
                            colours and patterns, such as red with black spots, that warn potential predators that they are distasteful.

                            The majority of the more than 6000 described species are generally considered beneficial insects, because many prey
                            on herbivorous hemipterans such as aphids or scale insects, which are agricultural pests. Many coccinellids lay
                            their eggs directly in aphid and scale insect colonies, ensuring their larvae have an immediate food source.
                            However, some species such as the herbivorous Mexican bean beetle are agricultural pests.
