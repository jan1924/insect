        <h2>INSECT <span>FACTS</span> </h2>
        <p>Did you know that insects make up about two-thirds of all living organisms on Earth? <br> There are over a million known species of insects, and scientists estimate that there may be millions more waiting to be discovered.</p>
        <p>Insects play important roles in ecosystems as pollinators, decomposers, and food for other animals. They also have many fascinating adaptations that allow them to survive in diverse environments.</p>

        <h2>OUR <span>MISSION</span></h2>
        <p>Our mission is to increase awareness and understanding of insects and their roles in the world. We believe that insects are often overlooked and misunderstood, and we want to change that.</p>
        <p>Through educational resources and interactive exhibits, we aim to provide a fun and engaging way for people of all ages to learn about these amazing creatures. We hope to inspire a sense of curiosity and wonder about the natural world and the important role that insects play in it.</p>
